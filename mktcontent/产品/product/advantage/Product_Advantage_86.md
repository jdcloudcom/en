		"proGood":"Usability",
		"proName":"The JCS for Kubernetes is created in the on-button manner via the console; the management node is provided with the fully-hosted design to remove tedious tasks, e.g. deployment, operations and upgrade; the customized image of work nodes is provided and a variety of components necessary for work nodes of the cluster are preset.",
		"proDiff":"Need to manually configure various modules, configuration files, certificates and plugs related to JCS for Kubernetes, with high complexity and long deployment time."
	},
	{
		"proGood":"Reliability",
		"proName":"In the same region, the management and work nodes of clusters can be deployed in different availability zone and a single cluster can at least operate three Virtual Machines as the management nodes, and meanwhile, the fault domain can be isolated based on the availability group of JD Cloud so as to further increase the reliability.",
		"proDiff":"To build a high-availability JCS for Kubernetes, it needs to consider the solutions related to configuration management and redundant backup of management and work nodes. The configuration process is complex, with great maintenance difficulty."

	{
		"proGood":"Featureality",
		"proName":"Based on JD Cloud SDN, it provides CNI network plug-in, relies on the high availability and reliability of JD Cloud VPC, and easily adapts to the network demand of different scale production environment; it provides the CSI storage plug-in, integrates the cloud disk of JD Cloud and provides the safe and reliable persistent storage; and it integrates JD Cloud Load Balancer service.",
		"proDiff":"When solving the Kubernetes cluster based on open source project, the operation and maintenance is tediou and the storage resources of cloud cannot be used. In such case, it needs to independently consider data persistence and reliability solutions, build service on one’s own to solve application network access demand of JCS for Kubernetes, achieving stability and reliability."
