		"proName":"It is ready for use upon payment and it is paid by consumption. It is synchronized with the latest GPU technology of the industry, and can be seamlessly switched to the GPU hardware. It can be dynamically matched with resources depending on service peak and trough, reducing waste of fund.",
		"proDiff":"The hardware facility purchase and operation and maintenance cost is very high; hardware upgrade and innovation needs to be done on one’s own; the resource expansion period is long and the cost is high; and it is easy to waste resources."

		"proGood":"Excellent Performance",
		"proName":"The enterprise-level GPU is adopted, which has high parallel capacity, high throughout, low delay, high-performance computing, graphic render and floating-point computing capacity. It can easily handle the high real-time and high-concurrency massive computing scenarios, meeting scientific computing scenario requirements of graphic image scenarios, deep learning and training, reasoning, etc.",
		"proDiff":"For the non-professional server configuration, it is hard to unify the device type; it is difficult to play the extreme hardware performance; the purchase cost is very high; and it needs a lot of inventories to meet the expansion demand."

	{
		"proGood":"Simple and Easy to Use",
		"proName":"Various graphic workstations, super-computing applications, deep-learning frames and computing clusters can be obtained by one click; resources can be created within several minutes; automatic deployment and perfect connection can be made; and 7X24h all-around operation and maintenance is applied, making you focus on core businesses.",
		"proDiff":"It needs to purchase the device on one’s own and the purchase period is very long. The one-time CAPEX investment is too high and the resource utilization is unbalanced; the professional operation and maintenance team is equipped; the manual disaster tolerance is required; and both the time and effort are required."

		"proGood":"Secure and Stable",
		"proName":"Isolate tenants, provide security protection, be connected to and be compatible with JD Cloud security products, provide 2G Anti-DDoS Basic for free, be able to monitor hardware status and device running status whenever and wherever via the independent out-of-band network.",
		"proDiff":"It needs to make the network plan at first and set up a security protection platform on one’s own. Additional security measures are required for the data center infrastructure layer and the cost of capital is very high."
