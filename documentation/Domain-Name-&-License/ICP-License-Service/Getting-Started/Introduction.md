# **Introduction of Filing**

## **Introduction:**

Website filing is the record of reporting events pointing to competent authorities, which is used for inspection and investigation. From the perspective of administrative law, the provisions from the Legislation Law and the Ordinance on the Archivist Filing of Regulations and Government Rules are mainly used in practice. The purpose of website filing is to prevent illegal website operations on the Internet and to prevent the spread of bad Internet information. If the website is not filed, it will be intercepted.

## **Common Filing Type:**

Initial Filing: New subject and website filing - filing number whose domain name and sponsor’s document number are all failed;

New Access Filing: The domain name has already obtained the filing number elsewhere, and it is required to transfer the filing information of domain name to JD Cloud & AI;

New Website Filing: Sponsor's document was filed in JD Cloud & AI, and the domain name in this filing was not filed in the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the PRC.

Note: The filing type is only used for distinguishing different filing preconditions of the user, and the actual operation process is the same. They are all submitted through the filing system of JD Cloud & AI.

## **Filing process:**

Filing refers to submitting filing applications to the filing system of the server provider when the domain is a domestic IP. If you have purchased one JD Cloud & AI server (**the monthly type with the period of validity greater than 3 months**) and there are demands for domain service filing, please carry out operation as shown in the figure below
