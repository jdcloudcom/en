### 4. Use HTTP DNS interface to resolve the domain

HTTP DNS uses HTTP interface to provide domain resolution service externally. The service access address is available on the Account Overview page. Each user has two service IP addresses, and may try the other service address when one service address is exceptional.

| Request Method | HTTP GET |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Service URL  | http://{service address}/v1/{Account_id}/d <br> {service address}: It is available in the access address bar on the console Account Overview page <br> {Account_id}: It is available in the account information bar on the console Account Overview page |

URL Parameter Description:

| qt       | Request Type   | No       | Record type that you need to obtain; if no type is transmitted, the record A is the default value; resolution of types A(IPv4) and AAAA(IPv6) are supported; one resolution type is transmitted for one request only   |
| ip       | IPv4 Address   | No       | Client Address                                                   |

Authentication Algorithm:

s = md5sum(dn-key-t)

Authentication Field Description
