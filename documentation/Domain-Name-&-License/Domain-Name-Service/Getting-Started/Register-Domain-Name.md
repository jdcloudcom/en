# Domain Name Registration

1. The system will save the domain name registration information that you have successfully registered for the first time. When you register the domain name again, you can see the domain name information template that was created successfully before;

2. If you still use the same information to register, you can choose the template and do not need to fill in the information again;

3. If the template information is modified, the domain name information of the template will be modified in batches. This function is a batch operation. If the information is modified for a single domain name, it will only take effect for the domain name information;

4. After the domain name payment is completed, we will submit your registration information to the registration management organization for approval, during which the domain name is under pre-registered status. If the registration information passes the registration management organization, the domain name will be under normal status, if your registration information includes unconventional information and may be rejected after review, we will return your payment back to your balance. The moderate domain name pre-registration status is instantaneous and will not be greater than 5 minutes. If the domain name is still pre-registered after successful payment, please contact our customer service;

5. The registration of the domain name follows the principle of first applying for registration first, and the management certification organization does not conduct any substantive examination on whether the domain name filed by the applicant company violates the rights of the third party. The registration of each domain name in ICANN is unique and non-repeatable.
