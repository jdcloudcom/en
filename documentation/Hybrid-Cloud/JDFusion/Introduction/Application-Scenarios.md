# Application Scenarios
## Multi-cloud Resource Management
Large enterprises may be provided with cloud services by multiple cloud vendors; each cloud service has a mass of resources; the management is extremely complicated. JDFusion provides the enterprise with a unified cloud resource management platform, by which the unified management can be carried out for multiple cloud resources. It reduces influence of the different interfaces provided by cloud vendors, and allows enterprise users to access and manage the cloud services provided by different cloud vendors with the console and standard APIs.
