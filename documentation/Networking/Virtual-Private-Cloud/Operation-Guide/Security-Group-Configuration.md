## **Security Group Configuration**

#### **Step 1, Create a Security Group**

1. Open JD Cloud & AI Console, select Elastic Compute >> VM >> Security Group Page (or Elastic Compute >> Container Service >> Security Group, where this Help takes VM as an example), click **Create** to popup the Create  window;

2. First, you need to select the region and VPC where the security group is located, and the security group can only be applied to VM/container instances in the same VPC. You can create a new security group in the VPC you have created. You can also click the **Create VPC** button to enter the New VPC page and create a new VPC. A maximum of 50 security groups can be created in a single VPC, and if the number of security groups in the selected VPC has reached 50, a message of **the security group quota limit for the selected VPC resource has reached 50** will be displayed, and then you need to re-select other VPC.

3. Later, input the security group name and description to describe the additional instructions for the security group rules, such as **the port 80, 443 in the inbound direction and outbound direction that have been opened**; it is recommended that you use the security group's use scenario or function as the name of the security group, for example, **Web Server Cluster Open Port 80**.

4. The new security group rejects all ingress and egress traffic by default.

#### **Step 2, Associate VM/Container Instance**

1. Open JD Cloud & AI Console and select Elastic Compute >> VM >> Security Group Page (or Elastic Compute >> Container Service >> Security Group, and this Help takes VM as an example), enter the console security group list page, Select the **Associate VM** button to popup the Associate VM  window; or click the security group name to enter the security group details page, select the **VM** TAB page, click the **Add** button to popup the Associate VM  window;

2. The Associate VM popup window provides a list of all available VMs in the current VPC; you can tick one or more VMs and click the **OK** button to associate the current security group with the selected VMs.

#### **Step 3, Disassociate VM/Container Instance**

1. Open JD Cloud & AI Console and select Elastic Compute >> VM >> Security Group Page (or Elastic Compute >> Container Service >> Security Group, where this Help takes VM as an example), click the security group name in the list to enter the details page, and select the **VM** tab page to display the list of VMs associated with the security group;

2. In the VM list, click the **Remove** button under the operation column to disassociate the corresponding VMs from the current security group.

#### **Step 4, Configure Outbound Rules**

The outbound rules are used to filter the network traffic of the VM to access the Internet or other VMs, with the settings as follows:

1. Open JD Cloud & AI Console and select Elastic Compute >> VM >> Security Group Page (or Elastic Compute >> Container Service >> Security Group, where this Help takes VM as an example), find the security Group that needs to configure outbound rules, click **Modify Outbound Rules** in the **More** operation or click the security group name to enter its details page;

![](/image/Networking/Virtual-Private-Cloud/Operation-Guide/Security-Group-Configuration/Step6.png)



2. Enter the outbound rule TAB page, click the **Edit Rules** button on the page to enter the outbound rule editing page;

![](/image/Networking/Virtual-Private-Cloud/Operation-Guide/Security-Group-Configuration/Step7.png)



3. Click the **Add New Rules** button at the bottom of the page to add a new outbound rule for the current security group, select the outbound rule type. The system will automatically match the corresponding protocol according to the selected outbound rule type, and then set the port in proper order (which supports a single port number, such as 80, and also supports a port range such as: 80-8080), destination IP (which supports a single IP or CIDR) to complete the configuration of an outbound rule;

     When the protocol type can only be an IPv4 address (e.g. ICMP protocol) or IPv6 address (e.g. ICMPv6 protocol), please enter a correct address
     
4. You can also edit the security group outbound rules that have been added on the page at any time;

5. Click the **Delete** button in the operation column to delete a corresponding outbound rule;

6. After completing the outbound rule editing, click the **Save** button at the top of the page to bring the newly modified security group rule into effect automatically;

**Please note that a security group rule is stateful, if you send a request from the VM sucessfully, the response traffic of such a request will be allowed to flow in regardless of the ingress security group rule sets.**



#### **Step 5, Configure Inbound Rules**

The ingress rule is used to filter the network traffic from the  internet or other VMs to access the current VM, with the settings as follows:

1. Open JD Cloud & AI Console and select Elastic Computing >> VM >> Security Group Page (or Elastic Compute >> Container Service >> Security Group, where this Help takes VM as an example), find the security group that needs to configure inbound rule, click **Modify Inbound Rules** in the **More** operation or click the security group name to enter its details page;

![](/image/Networking/Virtual-Private-Cloud/Operation-Guide/Security-Group-Configuration/Step9.png) 



2. Enter the inbound rules tab page, click the **Edit Rules** button on the page to enter the inbound rule editing page;

3. Click the **Add New Rules** button at the bottom of the page to add an inbound rule to the current security group, select the inbound rule type so that the system will automatically match the corresponding protocol according to the selected inbound rule type, and then set the port in proper order (which supports a single port number, such as 80, and also supports a port range such as: 80-8080), the destination IP (which supports a single IP or CIDR) to complete the configuration of an inbound rule;

     When the protocol type can only be an IPv4 address (e.g. ICMP protocol) or IPv6 address (e.g. ICMPv6 protocol), please enter a correct address

4. You can also edit the security group inbound rules that have been added on the page at any time;

5. Click the **Delete** button in the operation column to delete a corresponding inbound rule;

6. After completing the inbound rule editing, click the **Save** button at the top of the page to bring the newly modified security group rule into effect automatically.

#### **Step 6, Delete Security Group**

Only security groups that are not associated with a VM/container can be deleted.

Method 1: Open JD Cloud & AI Console and select Elastic Compute>>VM>>Security Group or Elastic Compute>>Container Service>>Security Group page. Click the **Delete** button in the security group operation to delete the corresponding security group;

Method 2: Open JD Cloud & AI Console and select Elastic Compute>>VM>>Security Group or Elastic Compute>>Container Service>>Security Group page, click the security group name on the page to enter the security group details page, and click the **Delete** button at the top right of the details page to delete the corresponding security group.
