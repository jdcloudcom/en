# Native Container Configuration Recommendations

The Native Container Instance and the Native Container Pod include the general type (vCPU: memory=1:4, mainly), compute optimized type (vCPU: memory=1:2), memory optimized type (vCPU: memory=1:8) and high frequency compute type (vCPU: memory=1:8), ranging from 1-core 1G to 72-core 576G. The users can select the instance type and corresponding configuration depending on their service scenarios.

**Universal Type**: Compute capacity for being used universally in variable customer scenario by enterprises, small and medium sized database; used for data processing and caching clusters that require certain memories and in scenarios of back end server of other enterprise applications;

**Compute optimized type**: It is designed for duty-type application scenario and used in scenarios of compute in batch, front end server of Web, data analysis and game service etc.;

**Memory optimized type**: It is designed for duty-type application scenarios; high performance database, data analysis and mining, main memory database, distributed memory cache, Hadoop, Spark cluster and other enterprises’ large memory requirement applications.

**High frequency computing type**: It is designed for the high frequency compute type application scenario, the high performance Web frontend server, high performance science and engineering application, MMO games, video coding and other scenarios.
