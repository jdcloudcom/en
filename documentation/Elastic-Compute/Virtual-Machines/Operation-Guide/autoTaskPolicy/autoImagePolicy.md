# Automatic Image Policy

JD Cloud & AI now supports the use of Automatic Image Policy to set periodic host backup tasks for your Virtual Machine. Automatic Image Policy is an automatic task policy that can periodically back up Virtual Machine data and make image for the user according to the rules specified by the user. You can be free from periodically and manually making images for Virtual Machines if you use this product.
	
	Please note:
	* At most 20 automatic image policies are allowed to be created for a single region. For additional demands, please make an application via a ticket

## Service restrictions
<div id="user-content-1"></div>

Automatic Image Policy is only applicable to Virtual Machines of the cloud disk system disk.
The local disk data disks in the Virtual Machine do not support snapshot, and the images generated via Automatic Image Policy does not include the local data disks in the Virtual Machine.
Images generated will occupy your image quota and snapshot quota. Where no quota is available, then no automatic image will be created as well. 

## Operation steps

### Create Automatic Image Policy
<div id="user-content-2"></div>

1. Access [Automatic Task Policy Console][1] to enter the Automatic Image Policy List page. Or access [JD Cloud & AI Console][2] and click **Elastic Compute**-**Virtual Machine**-**Automatic Task Policy** to enter the Automatic Image Policy List page.

2. Click **Create** to enter the Automatic Image Policy Creation page.

3. Select a region. Please note that Automatic Image Policy cannot be used across regions. For example, the policy in cn-north-1 cannot be associated with the Virtual Machines in cn-south-1. If the regions selected hit the limitation, you can open ticket to raise your limitation.

4. Fill in the name. The name cannot be empty, supporting Chinese, numbers, capital and lower-case letters, English underline "_" and line-through "-" with no more than 32 characters.

5. Add description. The description cannot be more than 256 characters.

6. Specify a execution start time. The execution start time refers to the time when the policy starts to be executed for the first time in accordance with the current rules. At the earliest, it needs to be 30 minutes after the current time, so you cannot specify any time within 30 minutes after the current time as the start time of the policy.

7. Specify the execution interval. You can select "hour", "day" or "week" as the unit. To avoid the excessive short interval between two tasks for the same policy and therefore resulting in conflicts, the shortest interval is 12 hours. The maximum interval is one year.

8. Select the disks associated with your image, namely, specify the Virtual Machine disks included in your image. Select **All Disks in the Virtual Machine**, and the system will create a Virtual Machine image. The image will not include any local data disk. Select **Specify Disk**. You can check the disk device names to be included in the image, and the system disk (vda) must be specified and cannot be canceled. If the specified disks exceed the disks attached to the Virtual Machine, the created image will not include the excessive part. If the specified disks include local data disks, the created image will not include local data disks.

9. Specify the policy status. The policy includes enabled and disabled status. The enabled policy can trigger the automatic image creation task, and the disabled policy cannot.


10. Policy log. To record the execution of policy, you can enable policy log here and specify the log delivery destination (log set and log theme). Before specifying the delivery destination, please make sure that you have created the related log set and log theme in [Log Service][3], with the "Cloud Product" as the "log source", the "Automatic Task Policy" as the "Cloud Product" and the "Automatic Image Policy Execution Log" as the "Log Type". For detailed operations, please refer to [Cloud Product Log Collection][4]
After specifying a delivery, you can find the related policy execution log in the log theme under the specified log set. If you delete the log theme or log set specified for the current policy, the current policy log function will be disabled automatically.
 

### Modify automatic image policy
<div id="user-content-3"></div>

1. You can modify the created automatic image policy. Click **Modify Policy** to enter the policy modification page
![](../../../../../image/vm/autotaskpolicy2.png)

2. You can modify the policy rules and information on this page. If you modify the execution start time, the next execution time will be changed accordingly. The execution start time shall be 30 minutes later. If you modify the execution interval, the modification will not affect the next execution time. After the next execution, the new execution interval will take effect. To avoid the excessive short interval between two tasks for the same policy, the interval between one execution time and the next execution time of the policy shall be kept at least at 12 hours.

### Associate resources
<div id="user-content-4"></div>

#### Associate Virtual Machine resources with the automatic image policy

1. Click **Associate Resource** at [Automatic Task Policy Console][1], or click the policy name to enter Details and then click **Operations** - **Associate Resource
![](../../../../../image/vm/autotaskpolicy4.png)

2. Check the Virtual Machine to be associated with the policy in the current region, and click **OK** to associate the automatic image policy with the Virtual Machine. The policy cannot be associated with the local disk system disk Virtual Machine. You cannot find your local disk system disk Virtual Machine on the list. Each Virtual Machine can only be associated with one automatic image policy. Operations on the Virtual Machine associated with the policy will disassociate it from the original policy.
