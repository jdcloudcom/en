# Manual Confirmation
If you want to add stop operation in a certain stage during the process of running CodePipeline, you only need to select **Yes** in [Manual confirmation] during the operation. When the process executes to the manual confirmation node, it will stop and send a notification email to the operator. The execution will continue after manual confirmation by the user.
