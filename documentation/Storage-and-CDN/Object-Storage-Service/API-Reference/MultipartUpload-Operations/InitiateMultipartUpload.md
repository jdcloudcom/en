# InitiateMultipartUpload

## MultipartUpload introduction

In addition to uploading files to OSS through PUT Object interface, OSS also provides another upload mode: Multipart Upload. User may use Multipart Upload mode for uploading in the application scenarios including (but not limited to):

1. Supporting breakpoint upload is needed.

2. Large files (such as files with the size of 500MB) are to be uploaded.

3. The network conditions are poor, and the link with OSS server is often cut off.

Before uploading files, the size of files to be uploaded cannot be determined.

## InitiateMultipartUpload             

Description: Before data transmission in the Multipart Upload mode, the interface must be called to initialize a new Multipart Upload event. User carries out actions related to Multipart Upload via the UploadId, including uploading the Part belonging to Multipart Upload, combining all Parts, terminating Multipart Upload, and listing out all the uploaded Parts, etc.

Detail Analysis:

1. When the action computes and verifies the signature, "?uploads‚Äù is required to be added in CanonicalizedResource.

2. Initializing Multipart Upload request will not influence the existing object with the same name.

3. After the server receives the initialized Multipart Upload request, it will return a request body in json format. There are three elements in the request body: Bucket, Key and UploadID. Please record the UploadID therein for subsequent Multipart related actions.

4. When initializing Multipart Upload requests, if x-jss-server-side-encryption Header is set, when uploading each part, the server will encrypted each part automatically for storage.
