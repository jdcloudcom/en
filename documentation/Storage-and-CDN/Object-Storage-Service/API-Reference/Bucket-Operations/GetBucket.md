|Marker|Mark the start point of this List Object. <br>Type: Character string|
|NextMarker|Start point of next List Object. <br>Type: Character string|
|Delimiter| is a character to group Object names. All names include assigned prefixes and the object between the first occurred delimiter characters is used as a set of elements--CommonPrefixes. <br>Type: Character string|
|MaxKeys|Maximum quantity of returned results in response requests. <br>Type: int|
|HasNext|Indicate whether all results have been returned; "true" represents that this time has not returned all results; "false" represents that this time has returned all results. <br>Type: Boolean<br>Effective value: true, false|
|Contents|Save a collection of each returned Object meta. <br>Type: List|
Key<br> Type of |Key|Object: Character string|
|ETag|ETag is Hash value of Object in JD Cloud Storage, which only reflect data contents of Object, but not includes Metadata.

Detail Analysis:

1. If accessed Bucket does not exist, including trying to access Bucket that cannot be created due to nonconventional naming, return 404 Not Found Error, error code: NoSuchBucket.

2. If there is no permission to access the Bucket, return 403 Forbidden Error, error code: AccessDenied.

3. When performing a conditional query, even if marker does not actually exist in the list, the return is also printed from the next one that conforms to the marker alphabetical order. If the max-keys are smaller than 0 or greater than 1000, the max-keys are automatically set to the default value of 1000.

4. If prefix is set as some folder name, the files that begin with this prefix can be listed, namely, all file folders and subfolders recursive under the folder. If the delimiter is also set to /, only the files in that folder will be listed under Contents in return, and the subfolder name of that folder will be listed under CommonPrefixes, files and folders recursive under the subfolder will not be displayed. When three objects exist under one bucket: jingdong/test.jpg, jingdong/dir/file, jingdong/dir/file2, if prefix is set to "jingdong/", three objects are returned; if delimiter is additionally set to "/", files "jingdong/test.jpg" will be returned in Contents and folders "jingdong/dir" will be returned in CommonPrefixes; namely, the logic of folder is implemented.

5. marker is the start marker of Object information sorted in dictionary order, the result does not include marker, marker can be set as the last Key in this list to get other Object information unreturned in this action, which is Usually used with maxKeys to implement paging.
