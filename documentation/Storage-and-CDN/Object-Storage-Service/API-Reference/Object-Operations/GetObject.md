**Request Header**

Range specifies the obtained Object data content. If set   bytes=0-9, it represents transferring the 0th to 9th characters, totally 10 characters. For more information, refer to RFC2616

Detail Analysis:
1.GetObject may support breakpoint upload via range parameter, and the function is recommended for large Objects.

2. If Range parameter is used in request header; the returned message will contain the length of the whole file and the returned range, for example: Content-Range: bytes 0-9/44, representing that the length of the whole file is 44.

3. If the file does not exist, 404 Not Found error will be returned. Error code: NoSuchKey.

4. If the Object is stored as encrypted by the server, it will be decrypted automatically and returned to the user when GET the request.
