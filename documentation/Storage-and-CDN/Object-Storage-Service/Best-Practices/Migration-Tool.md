### 4. Running Migration Tool
#### Linux

```
java -jar transfer-tools-java-1.0.0.jar --Dspring.config.location=application.yml

```
### Osstransfer Instructions

1. Osstransfer Migration Tool is generally divided into three types of jobs, including listObject, transfer, respectively. During migration, each file put uploaded and multipart uploaded is subject to md5 comparison.

2. The single file in file migration is 19.5T at largest.

3. When implementing Data Migration Service from the cloud vendor, only the permission of public reading of the source Bucket is supported; otherwise, it will result in migration failure.

4. The maximum length of JD Cloud OSS is 1022 bytes. Therefore, files larger than 1022 bytes cannot be migrated.

5. AWS S3 endpoint only supports https.

6. object key includes char(10) line feed, char(13) enter does not migrate.

7. The maximum of JD Cloud OSS Content-Disposition is 100 bytes, it is recommended to set ContentDispositionTooLongContinue configuration item as true when using Osstransfer,
In this way, when Content-Disposition exceeds 100 bytes, it is guaranteed that migration of files is successful.


## Migration Principles and Process
### Principle Description

Osstransfer Migration Tool uses sdk first to implement list for each data source to get the list of object. The goal is that if there are object changes during the migration, the migration tool will not be affected.

### Migration Process
1. During the migration process, the migration log will be printed to the./log directory by default.

All migrated files will be printed to audit-0.log, the files that migrated successfully will be printed to audit.success log, if the files that fail in migration need to be screened out, please use the command:

```
grep "1$" audit-0.log*
```
Implement screening.

2. Audit Log Description

|Name|Description|
|:-|:-|
|version|The version number of audit log is currently 1.|
|message| If migration fails, the content is the reason of migration failure. |
|readline|Read content of object list.| 
|time|Time of Migration.|
|url|url of Source of Migration.|
|key|Name of object of Migration.|
|messageFormat|0 represents successful formatting, 1 represents failure.|
|headHttpCode|Status Code of head url.|
|objectSize|Size of object.|
|jssMethod|The used upload method includes PUT or MULTIPART.|
|getAmazonS3Client| Get the status of s3client, 0 represents success, 1 represents failure.|
|getHttpCode|Status Code of get url.|
|responseEntity|0 represents that responseEntity is not null, 1 represents null.|
|uploadStatus|0 represents put upload success, 1 represents upload failure.|
|checkStatus|0 represents check success after put is uploaded, 1 represents check failure.|
|retryCount|Time of Upload Try Again.|
|abortMultipartUpload|0 represents multipart upload success, 1 represents sharding failure, abort such multipart upload.|
|checkMultipartUpload|0 represents successful check of multipart uploaded files, 1 represents check failure.|
|responseTime|Time-consuming of Migration.|
