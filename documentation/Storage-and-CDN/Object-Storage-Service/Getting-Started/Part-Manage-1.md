# Shard Management

In case of multipart upload, Object will be cut into several Parts, and these Parts are called shards. After you upload these Parts to OSS server, you can call CompleteMultipartUpload to combine these Parts into a complete Object.

**Description**

* Parts will be generated in case of uploading large files with the Console.
* When files are transmitted with OSS management tool supporting breakpoint upload, parts will also be generated.
* You can also realize multipart upload by direct calling of API. Please refer to [Multipart Upload](https://docs.jdcloud.com/en/object-storage-service/initiate-multipart-upload-2)
* You can call CompleteMultipartUpload to combine Parts into a complete Object. See details in [CompleteMultipartUpload](https://docs.jdcloud.com/en/object-storage-service/complete-multipart-upload-2).
* Parts cannot be read before the completion of Object. In case of Bucket deletion, the Objects and Parts in the Bucket must all be deleted first.
* Shards are mainly generated by multipart upload operation, and you can directly call to [Abort Multipart Upload](https://docs.jdcloud.com/en/object-storage-service/abort-multipart-upload-2). For deletion of uncompleted Parts, you can also delete Parts through Console shard management.
