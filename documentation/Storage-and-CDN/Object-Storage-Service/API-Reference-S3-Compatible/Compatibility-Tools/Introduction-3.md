# Overview

Most tools developed based on AWS S3 are available on JD Cloud Storage. When using these tools, you generally need to configure three items: accesskey, secretkey, and endpoint.

## accesskey and secretkey

These two values are a credential of the user's identity, which are used when checking the signature. You can get these two values in the console of JD Cloud.

## endpoint

endpoint is used to specify the service domain name; https is not supported now, so you can only set it as http.

We will introduce some commonly used tools in the following part, including: sdk-python, sdk-java, sdk-php, CloudBerry. Our introduction will help you get started quickly. Please refer to the related documents for more detailed information.
