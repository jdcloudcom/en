# Benefits

## Stable and Reliable

The Cloud File Service adopts three-copy redundancy storage offering super powerful stability and reliability which can satisfy the needs of your application services on the availability and reliability of file system.

## Complete Hosting Service

You can expediently create and manage file storage in Cloud File Service through Console or SDK and use it by creating attached targets without deployment, operation and maintenance of file system services.

## Easy-to-use

Your Virtual Machines in JD Cloud can access the file storage system through the standard NFS v4.1 protocol. Cloud File Service provides fully-hosted services and is compatible to POSIX interfaces, so you do need to modify applications and can implement seamless integration via standard attach steps of file system. It significantly reduces migration cost and simplifies development of cloud projects.

## Shared Access

You can share the file storage system in the same Cloud File Service among multiple Virtual Machines in the same Subnet. Scenarios where multiple application instances require shared general data sources are particularly suitable to be implemented with Cloud File Service.

## Elastic Expansion

It is unnecessary to preset the configuration capacity when you create file storage in Cloud File Service. The file storage capacity can implement auto scaling according to your operation of adding or deleting files.

## Multiple Security Protection

The Cloud File Service can control access to file system by means of the network isolation mechanism between user's VPCs and POSIX file system standard permission control mechanism.
