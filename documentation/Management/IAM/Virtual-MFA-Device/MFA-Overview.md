# What is the MFA?
MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) is a simple and effective best security practice. It can add an extra layer of security protection in addition to the user name and password, and it can perform identity authentication to prevent false deletion when JD Cloud performs sensitive operations.

Virtual MFA equipment is a software-based application that generates dynamic verification codes. It follows the Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) Standard (RFC 6238), and can install virtual MFA equipment to different mobile equipment, such as smartphones. After MFA is enabled, when a user logs in JD Cloud, the system will require a user name and password and then require a 6-digit dynamic verification code from his or her MFA equipment. Even if someone steals your password, this person will not be able to log in your account. Two-factor security verification will ensure the security of your account to the utmost extent.

# JD Cloud Assistant
JD Cloud Assistant (WeChat applet) is the unified virtual MFA equipment provided by JD Cloud for the convenience of users. It is recommended that you associate to your user information through this application to generate dynamic verification codes.
