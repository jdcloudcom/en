# Core Concepts

**File Format**

The file format of VOD videos usually includes MP4, AVI, MKV, WMV, MPG and FLV. Videos with different formats have different image qualities and compress standards, as well as different adaption for terminal play. FLV format is widely used in network VOD due to its relatively small file size and faster load speed. Video with MP4 format is the most common VOD format, which has stronger compatibility to various types of terminals.

**Code Rate**

Code rate refers to data traffic that a video file uses per unit of time, which is also called code stream or code stream rate and it is the most important part of picture quality control in video encoding. The unit of measure is "bit per second" (bit/s or bps), which Kbps (the number of thousands of bits per second) or Mbps are often used.

**Resolution**

Resolution refers to the count of pixels in one frame of picture, e.g., 1280x720, which determines the fine extent of video picture details. In general, the higher the resolution of video, the more pixels it contains and the clearer the picture will be.

**Frame Rate**

Frame rate refers to a unit of measure for video display frames per unit of time, i.e., count of images refreshed per second.

**Transcoding**

Video transcoding refers to converting source video stream into several video streams with different resolutions, code rates and frame rates to adapt different network bandwidths, terminal handling abilities and requirements of users.

**Encapsulation Conversion**

Encapsulation conversion refers to converting encapsulated formats of videos or audios, e.g., when converting FLV video into MP4, the video and audio code stream is directly obtained from one encapsulated format file and packaged as another encapsulated format file other than encoding and decoding the video and audio during the process.
