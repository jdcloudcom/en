# Core Concepts
- DOS (Denial of Service), a denial of service attack. By attacking the defect of the target system, or consuming most of the target system resources, DOS drives the target system unavailable for services. The victim will fail to respond normal requests for services.
- DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service attack), a distributed denial of service attack. By means of hacker's technique, the attacker combines multiple computers into a “zombie machine”. As ordered by the attacker, "zombie machine" carries out DDoS attacks on one or multiple targets, causing as serveral times damage as DOS. So the victim is unable to provide network services.

- Flow cleaning: JD Cloud servers provide Anti-DDoS by default. Once the network traffic exceeds the threshold, runs automatically the procedure of flow cleaning for the IP. The procedure comprises serveral steps: redirecting the flow from the original network to a cleaner device, performing judgments on the flow components in the cleaner device, discarding the abnormal part, limiting the arriving flow to protect the final server, reducing the harm caused by attack to the server. The cleaning may impact on normal portions of the flow.

- Black Hole: Once the attacking flow exceeds the configured maximum of protection capacity, the cloud will block all access to the server. For Anti-DDoS Basic, a flow exceeding 2G triggers a black hole.
