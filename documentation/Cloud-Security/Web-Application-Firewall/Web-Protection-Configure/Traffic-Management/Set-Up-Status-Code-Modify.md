# Set Status Code Modification

Web Application Firewall supports modifying status codes. You can apply it to the origin server to ensure user experience, so that users do not access abnormal pages, such as 502, 504, and 404. In this case, the origin server can set the status code modification on WAF to point abnormal status such as 502 and 504 to normal status and then to a normal page. On this page, we mainly introduce how to modify the status code.
