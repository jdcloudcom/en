# Enable IPv6 Protection

After the website is accessed to the Web Application Firewall, you can enable the IPv6 protection function with one click. IPv6 protection protects the website from attacks launched in the IPv6 environment, helping origin servers provide security protection for IPv6 protocol requests.

## Prerequisites

- A Web Application Firewall instance has been enabled. For more information, please refer to [Enable Web Application Firewall](https://docs.jdcloud.com/en/web-application-firewall/purchase-process).
  - The specification of the instance package is **Enterprise Version** or above. For more information, please refer to [Version Function Description](https://docs.jdcloud.com/en/web-application-firewall/price-overview).
- The website has been accessed. For more information, please refer to [Add Domain](https://docs.jdcloud.com/en/web-application-firewall/step-1).

## Background Information

With the rapid popularization of the IPv6 protocol, new security challenges appear in new network environments and emerging areas. The IPv6 protection function of the Web Application Firewall can help you easily build a security protection system covering the whole world.

After the IPv6 security protection function is enabled, the CNAME address automatically generated by the Web Application Firewall will achieve dual resolution. The resolution rules are as follows:

- The resolution request initiated by the IPv4 client will be resolved to a protection cluster of the IPv4 address.
- The resolution request initiated by the IPv6 client will be resolved to a protection cluster of the IPv6 address.

Dual resolution achieves threat detection and defense against IPv4 and IPv6 traffic and forwards secure access traffic to the origin server. Of which, IPv6 traffic will be automatically converted to IPv4 traffic and then forwarded back to the origin server.

## Operation Steps

1. Log in [Web Application Firewall Console](https://cloudwaf-console.jdcloud.com/overview/business).

2. Click **Website Configuration** on the left navigation bar.

3. Locate the domain to be operated on the **Web Configuration** page and enable the **IPv6 Status** switch.
