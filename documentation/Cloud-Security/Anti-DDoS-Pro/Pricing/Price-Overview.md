# Billing Instructions
The price of Anti-DDoS Pro products is as follows, wherein the elastic protection is optional.


## Basic Protection
The minimum bandwidth protection is of Pay-In-Advance mode monthly, specifically as follows:

DDoS protective capability (Gbps)	| CC defense peak value (QPS)	| Telecom cost (RMB/month)	| Telecom+Unicom cost (RMB/month)	|Telecom+Unicom+CMCC cost (RMB/month) |
:---|:--- |---: |---: |---:
| 10 | 30,000 | 6000 | 8000 | 10,000 |
|20|60,000|12,800|15,800|18,800|
|30|105,000|17,800|21,800|25,800|
|40|150,000|29,800|34,800|39,800|
|50|225,000|39,800|45,800|51,800|
|60|300,000|65,800|72,800|79,800|

|100|450,000|147,800|156,800|165,800|

## Elastic Protection
Elastic Protection Part is charged daily, according to the actual charge generated the day before. For attack peak exceeding basic DDoS capability (Gbps) or CC defense capability (QPS), the major billing interval prevails.</br>
Details are as follows:

DDoS Protective Capability|	CC Defense Peak Value| Cost (RMB/day)|
:---|:--- |---: |
|0Gbps < Elastic Peak Value ≤ 10Gbps|<= 30,000QPS|800
|10Gbps < Elastic Peak Value ≤ 20Gbps|	30,000 QPS < Attack Peak Value ≤ 60,000 QPS	|1000
|20Gbps < Elastic Peak Value ≤ 30Gbps|	60,000 QPS < Attack Peak Value ≤ 105,000 QPS	|1500
|30Gbps < Elastic Peak Value ≤ 40Gbps|	105,000 QPS < Attack Peak Value ≤ 150,000 QPS	|2600
|40Gbps < Elastic Peak Value ≤ 50Gbps|	150,000 QPS < Attack Peak Value ≤ 225,000 QPS	|3400
|50Gbps < Elastic Peak Value ≤ 60Gbps| 225,000 QPS < Attack Peak Value ≤ 300,000 QPS	|5300
|60Gbps < Elastic Peak Value ≤ 70Gbps| 300,000 QPS < Attack Peak Value ≤ 337,500 QPS	| 7000
|70Gbps < Elastic Peak Value ≤ 80Gbps| 337,500 QPS < Attack Peak Value ≤ 375,000 QPS	|8000
|80Gbps< Elastic Peak Value ≤90Gbps| 375,000 QPS < Attack Peak Value ≤ 412,500 QPS	|8600
|90Gbps < Elastic Peak Value ≤ 100Gbps| 412,500 QPS < Attack Peak Value ≤ 450,000 QPS	|9500
|100Gbps < Elastic Peak Value ≤ 120Gbps| 450, 000 QPS < Attack Peak Value ≤ 487,500 QPS	|11000
|120Gbps < Elastic Peak Value ≤ 150Gbps	| 487,500 QPS < Attack Peak Value ≤ 675,000 QPS	|13000
|150Gbps < Elastic Peak Value ≤ 200Gbps| 675,000 QPS < Attack Peak Value ≤ 900,000 QPS|	17000

## Business Bandwidth:
By default, 100 Mbps is gifted. You can purchase larger business bandwidth if needed. The business bandwidth and basic protection have the same purchase cycle.
RMB 4000 per 50Mbps. 2000Mbps can be purchased at most.
