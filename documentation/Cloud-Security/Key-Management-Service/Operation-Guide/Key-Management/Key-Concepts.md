# Concept of Key

The Key is an important parameter in the encryption and decryption process; for the Key Management Service of JD Cloud, the 32-byte (256-bit) symmetric Key is used for encryption and decryption; and in general, the greater the bit of the Key, the safer the encrypted and decrypted data.

Encryption refers to a method of switching the plaintext data into the ciphertext data by using keys and specific encryption algorithm, while decryption refers to a method of decrypting the ciphertext data into the plaintext data by using the same keys and reversible encryption algorithm.
