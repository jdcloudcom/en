# Setting of Protection Rules

Protection rule takes effect for the entire anti-DDoS protection package instance by default. If the shared IP is purchased, setting for the refined protection rules for a certain IP is also supported.

## Configuration for default protection rules
1. Log in the anti-DDoS basic protection console to find out the menu **Protection Package --> List of Protection Packages**.</br>

3. Protection rules are set as shown in the figure below:</br>

   All default protection rules are in the closing state; after started, the protection thresholds preset in the system will be displayed.

## Configurations of single IP protection rules

If the purchased package is a shared IP, the detailed configuration is allowed for the certain IP. Procedures are as below:

1. Position to the protection package to be configured with the protection rules, and click **Protection Object Setting** in the action bar**</br>
