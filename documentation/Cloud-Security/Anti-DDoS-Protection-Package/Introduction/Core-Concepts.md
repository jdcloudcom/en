# Core Concepts
See the following for the concepts and their interpretations used in the Anti-DDoS Protection Package help documentation.

- **DoS (Denial of Service)**: namely denial of service attack. The attack takes advantage of the functional defects of the network service of the target system or directly consumes its system resources, with the aim to make the target customer's system unavailable and unable to provide normal service.

- **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service attack)**: namely distributed denial of service attack. It refers to combine multiple computers to change into "zombie hosts" by the use of hacker technology, and jointly launch DDoS attacks on one or more targets to deny power of service attack in multiple times, making it impossible for the victims to provide network services.

- **Black Hole**: black hole means that JD Cloud will block Internet access of the server when the traffic of the attack suffered by the server exceeds the protection cap of the Anti-DDoS Protection Package purchased by the user.
